\section{Introduction}

Car sequencing is the first benchmark in the constraint programming library (prob001 in CSPLib \cite{Gent99}). The
associated decision problem (is there a production sequence for cars on the assembly line satisfying the sliding
capacity constraints?) has been shown to be NP-complete \cite{Kis04}\cite{Gent98}.  To date, however, it has not
received much attention from the SAT community.  This is disappointing as we show here that SAT is a very effective
technology to solve such problems. We introduce several CNF encodings for this problem that demonstrate the strength of
SAT solvers. Furthermore, we identify new lower bounds by a preprocessing technique and by SAT solving.

The paper is organised as follows. First we formally introduce the car sequencing problem. Then in Section
\ref{sec:modelling} we define the CNF encodings and discuss their properties. A direct method to compute lower bounds is
explained in Section \ref{sec:lower}. In Section \ref{sec:experiments} we evaluate the CNF encodings on the CSPLib
benchmark and show results on the lower bounds. 

%\subsection{SAT Solving}
%
%First we will state some preliminary definitions and then give a brief background on satisfiability solving. 
%
%Given a set of Boolean variables $X = \{x_1, x_2 \ldots x_n\}$, a literal is of the form $x_i$ or $\neg x_i$ and a
%clause is a disjunction of literals. A formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) if it is a conjunction of
%disjunctions of literals. The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) requests a satisfying assignment to a given formula
%in CNF or a proof if no such assignment exists. A clause with one literal is called a unit clause. 
%
%The SAT problem is considered the canonical NP-complete problem, and in addition to its theoretical relevance it is used
%to solve practical problems. The general idea is to reduce a given NP-complete problem to a (possibly large) formula in
%CNF and apply a general purpose SAT solver to find an assignment or prove unsatisfiability. 
%
%In the last two decades there has been tremendous research in both theoretical and practical SAT solving techniques, for
%a comprehensive overview we refer to \cite{Biere09}. For the scope of this paper briefly we mention the basic underlying
%algorithm to most successful SAT solvers and its mayor extensions. The DPLL algorithm (\cite{Putnam60}) is a backtrack
%search that extends partial assignments and reasons in each node with a method called unit propagation (UP). UP
%identifies literals in clauses that have become unit under the current assignment and forces the assignment of this
%literal such that the clause is satisfied. Further improvements to the DPLL algorithms go under the name of
%Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers. These solvers record an appropriate reason for each conflict in the
%search and potentially prune unseen parts of the search tree. Furthermore, SAT solvers contain robust domain-independent
%branching, decision and restart heuristics and in many cases solve formulas with millions of variables and clauses. Nowadays
%application of SAT solving techniques reach from formal verification to the domain of logistical problems. 

\subsection{Car Sequencing}

Car sequencing deals with the problem of scheduling cars along an assembly line with capacity constraints for different
stations (e.g. radio, sun roof, air-conditioning, etc). Cars are partitioned into classes according to their
requirements. Let $C$ and $O$ be disjoint sets of classes and options. To each class $k\in C$ there is given a demand of
cars $d_k$ to be scheduled. Each option $l\in O$ is limited to $u_l$ occurrences on each subsequence of length $q_l$
(denoted as a capacity constraint $u_l/q_l$), i.e.  no more than $u_l$ cars with option $l$ can be sequenced among $q_l$
consecutive cars. To each class $k\in C$ we denote the set $O_k$ of options it requires and for convenience to each
option $l\in O$ we denote $C_l$ the set of classes that require this options. A solution is a valid sequence of all
cars. 

Let $n$ be the length of the total sequence. The following pseudo Boolean model is a basis for our translation to CNF.
We use 0/1 variables $c^k_i$ to denote that a car $k\in C$ is at position $i$, likewise $o^l_i$ for option $l\in O$. For
the sequence it must hold: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Demand constraints: $\forall k \in C$ $$\sum^n_{i=1} c^k_i = d_k$$                       
    \item Capacity constraints: $\forall l \in O$ with ratio $u_l/q_l$ $$\bigwedge_{i=0}^{n-q_l}(\sum_{j=1}^{q_l} o^l_{i+j} \leq u_l )$$
\end{itemize}
        And in all positions $i \in \{1\ldots n\}$ of the sequence it must hold:                                                    
\begin{itemize}
    \item Link between classes and options: for each $k\in C$ and 
        \begin{align*}
            \forall l \in O_k :\;\; & c^k_i - o^l_i \leq 0 \\
            \forall l \in O \text{ with } l \not \in O_k :\;\; &c^k_i + o^l_i \leq 1\\
        \end{align*}
    \item Exactly one car:  $$\sum_{k\in C} c^k_i = 1$$  
\end{itemize}

\begin{example} 
    Given classes $C = \{1,2,3\}$ and options $O = \{a,b\}$. The demands (number of cars) for the classes are $3,2,2$
    and capacity constraints on options are $1/2$ and $1/5$, respectively. Class 1 has no restrictions, class 2 requires
    option $a$ and class 3 needs options $\{a, b\}$. Given these constraints the only legal sequence for this problem is
    $[3,1,2,1,2,1,3]$, since class 2 and 3 cannot be sequenced after another and class 3 need to be at least 5 positions
    apart.
\end{example}                                     

Car sequencing in the CSPLib contains a selection of benchmark problems of this form ranging from 100 to 400 cars. Over
the years different approaches have been used to solve these instances, among them constraint programming, local search
and integer programming \cite{Regin97}\cite{Gottlieb03}\cite{Gravel05}\cite{Estellon06}\cite{Siala12}.

Car sequencing has also been treated as an optimisation problem, although the literature does not agree on a common
optimisation function and several versions have been proposed. There are several variations for the optimisation
function minimising the number of violated capacity constraints. However, in this paper we use the definition of
\cite{Perron04} which naturally transforms to a sequence of decision problem and SAT solving can be directly applied:
An unsatisfiable car sequencing problem can be made solvable by adding empty slots (also called dummy cars) to
the sequence. The task is then to minimise the number of dummy cars needed to generate a valid sequence.
          
We state the optimisation function for which we show lower bounds and for completeness provide also the optimisation
function to which we compare in Section \ref{sec:experiments}: 

\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Let $z\in C$ be the class of additional cars that require no options with variable demand $d_z \in
    \mathbb{N}$. The optimisation function is then $$\min \;\; d_z$$
    \item Let $v^l_{i}$ be 1 if the capacity constraint of option $l$ is violated in the subsequence starting at
        position $i$, otherwise 0. Then the optimisation function is $$\min \sum_{l\in O} \sum_{i=1}^{n-q_l+1} v_i^l$$
\end{enumerate} 

%Usually the values for both functions coincide and solutions are interchangeable. 

\section{Modelling the Car Sequencing Problem}
\label{sec:modelling}

In this section we introduce different ways to model the car sequencing problem in CNF. The basic building blocks are
cardinality constraints of the form $\sum_{i\in \{1\ldots n\}} x_{i} = d$ and $ \sum_{i\in \{1\ldots n\}} x_{i} \leq d
$.

First we describe how to translate cardinality constraints as a variant of the sequential counter encoding proposed by
\cite{Sinz05}. Then we show how to enforce a global view by integrating capacity constraint into the sequential counter.
We then show that this combination of the demand and the capacity constraints can be used both for classes and options
and we define three complete encodings for the car sequencing problem. 

\subsection{Sequential Counter Encoding}
\label{sub:card}

We describe how to encode a cardinality constraint of the form $ \sum_{i\in \{1\ldots n\}} x_{i} = d $ where $x_i$ are
0/1 variables and $d\in \mathbb{N}$ is a fixed demand. The key idea is to introduce auxiliary variables to represent
cumulative sums.

In this section we use two types of variables, for each position $i$

\begin{itemize}
    \item  $x_i$ is true iff an object (class or option) is at position $i$
    \item  $s_{i,j}$ is true iff in the positions $0,1 \ldots i$ the object exists at least $j$ times (for technical
        reasons $0 \leq j \leq d+1$). 
\end{itemize} 

The following set of clauses (\ref{eq:1}) to (\ref{eq:5}) define the sequential counter encoding:

$\forall i \in \{1\ldots n\}$ $\forall j \in\{0 \ldots d+1\}$: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
    \neg s_{i-1,j} \vee s_{i,j}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
    x_{i} \vee \neg s_{i,j} \vee s_{i-1,j}
\end{equation}

$\forall {i \in \{1\ldots n\}} \forall {j\in \{1\ldots d+1\}}$: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
    \neg s_{i,j} \vee s_{i-1,j-1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
    \neg x_{i} \vee \neg s_{i-1,j-1} \vee s_{i,j}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
     s_{0,0} \wedge \neg s_{0,1} \wedge s_{n,d} \wedge \neg s_{n,d+1}
\end{equation}

The variables $s_{i,j}$  represent the bounds for cumulative sums for the sequence $x_1 \ldots x_i$. The encoding is
best explained by visualising $s_{i,j}$ as a two dimensional grid with positions (horisontal) and cumulative sums
(vertical). The binary clauses (\ref{eq:1}) and (\ref{eq:3}) ensures that the counter (i.e. the variables representing
the cumulative sums) is monotonically increasing. Clauses (\ref{eq:2}) and (\ref{eq:4}) control the interaction with the
variables $x_i$. If $x_i$ is true, then the counter has to increase at position $i$ whereas if $x_i$ is false an
increase is prevented at position $i$. The conjunction (\ref{eq:5}) sets the initial values for the counter to start
counting at 0 and ensures that the total sum at position $n$ is equal to $d$. 


\begin{example}
The auxiliary variables $s_{i,j}$ with $d=2$ over a sequence of 10 variables. The cells with  $U$($L$) and
above(below) are set to false (true) by preprocessing. The question mark identifies yet unassigned variables. Left:
before variable assignments, right: after variable assignment $x_2$ and $x_7$ to true.
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
\include{example1}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
\include{example2}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\label{ex:1}
\end{example}

The encoding in \cite{Sinz05} follows a similar idea and focuses on inequalities. The encoding here can easily be
adapted to represent such constraints by removing $s_{n,d}$ from the conjunction (\ref{eq:5}). Then the counter accepts
all assignments to $x_1 \ldots x_n$ with up to $d$ variables set to true. Comparing the resulting clauses there are
small differences between the encoding proposed here and the one in \cite{Sinz05}. In particular, we use twice as many
clauses and but ensure uniqueness by means of the auxiliary variables, i.e. we ensure the same model count. Our encoding
also has similarities to the translation of cardinality constraints through Binary Decision Diagrams, see \cite{Een06}.

\subsection{The Capacity Constraint}
\label{sub-capacity}

We now show how to translate the interleaving capacity constraints to CNF. Each subsequence of length $q$ can have at
most $u$ true assignments. Thus, the capacity constraints are a sequence of cardinality expressions. 

$$\bigwedge_{i=0}^{n-q}(\sum_{l=1}^q x_{i+l} \leq u )$$

We will translate this expression to CNF in two ways. The straight forward way is to encode a sequential counter for
each subsequence separately. This will introduce independent auxiliary variables for each subsequence. The second way is
more elaborate and is explained in this section.

The idea is to encode a more global view into the demand constraint by integrating the capacity of each subsequence into
the counter. We intend to encode the global view on the following expression: 

$$ (\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i} = d) \wedge \bigwedge_{i=0}^{n-q}(\sum_{l=1}^q x_{i+l} \leq u )$$

Interestingly, we can reuse the auxiliary variables of the sequential counter and impose the following set of clauses: 

$\forall {i \in \{q \ldots n\}}$, $\forall {j\in\{u\ldots d+1\}}$: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:6}
    \neg s_{i,j} \vee s_{i-q,j-u}
\end{equation}               

The clauses restrict the internal counting not to exceed the capacities constraints and the encoding detects
dis-entailment on the conjunction of the demand constraint and the capacity constraints by unit propagation. In
particular, these binary clauses improve propagation when branched on auxiliary variables. The following example will
demonstrate the way the binary clauses of (\ref{eq:6}) work. It also demonstrates how much propagation is missing if the
capacity constraints would be translated separately. 

\begin{example}
\label{ex:large} See tables in Figure \ref{fig3} for a visualisation of the variables. We construct the grid for 
capacity constraints with ratio $4/8$ and a demand of $d=12$ on a sequence of 22 variables. Unit propagation will force $x_{7}$,
$x_{8}$, $x_{15}$ and $x_{16}$ to be false prior to search. The second table examines the variables after decisions
$x_{1}$ and $x_{13}$ to true and $x_{12}$, $x_{14}$ and $x_{21}$ to false.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
\centering 
\caption{The grid of variables of Example \ref{ex:large}. Notation for bottom row: normal font = decision variable, bold
    = propagated, in brackets = propagated previously. Notice the amount of propagation due to the clauses (\ref{eq:6}),
    the interesting two cases are shown by an arrow. These values would not have been found by unit propagation without
    the clauses (\ref{eq:6}). (Configuration of this example taken from
\cite{Siala12}).}
\include{example3}
\include{example4}
\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

It is easy to see that the number of auxiliary variables is not more than $n\cdot d$. Since clauses (\ref{eq:1}) to
(\ref{eq:5}) and (\ref{eq:6}) are generated for each auxiliary variable, the encoding consists of $3\cdot n \cdot d$
binary clauses and $2 \cdot n \cdot d$ ternary clauses. Note that many clauses become unit in preprocessing, this number
increases the stricter the capacity constraints are. E.g. in Example \ref{ex:large} with $n=20$, $d=12$ and $4/8$ there are
effectively only $24$ unassigned variables after the first unit propagation. 

In the following example we show a situation where clauses (\ref{eq:6}) do not prune all values with unit propagation,
whereas translating each capacity constraint to a counter would do so. 

\begin{example}\label{ex:small}
 \begin{minipage}[c]{.58\linewidth} Let $n=5$, $d=2$ with a capacity constraint of $1/2$, and let $x_3$ be true, then
     unit propagation does not force $x_2$ nor $x_4$ to false. Setting them to true will lead to a conflict through
     clauses (\ref{eq:4}) and (\ref{eq:6}) on positions 2, 3 and 4.
   \end{minipage} \hfill
   \begin{minipage}[c]{.36\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccccccccc}
3   &   &   &   &U  &U  &U  \\
2   &   &U  &U  &.  &.  &L  \\
1   &U  &.  &.  &L  &L  &   \\
0   &L  &L  &L  &   &   &   \\
\hline
$s_{i,j}$ &0  &1  &2  &3  &4  &5 \\
$x_i$     &  &.  &.  &1  &.  &.  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{small} 
\end{center}     
   \end{minipage}
\end{example}

The encoding presented here is in fact similar to a special case of the encoding of the \gseq constraint in
\cite{Bacchus07}. One difference lies in their auxiliary variables $q_i^j$ that encode the equality $\sum_{l=1}^i x_l =
j$.  This also changes the size and shape of the clauses and will have different behaviour when branching on auxiliary
variables. 

\subsection{Link Cars and Options}
\label{sub:link}

For a complete CNF translation of car sequencing we need to link classes and options. This is done by the following
clauses. 

$\forall i\in \{1\ldots n\}$: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:7}
     \bigwedge_{\substack{k \in C \\ l \in O_k }} \neg c^k_{i} \vee o^l_{i}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:8}
    \bigwedge_{\substack{k \in C \\ l \not \in O_k}} \neg c^k_{i} \vee \neg o^l_{i}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:9}
    \bigwedge_{l\in O} \left(\neg o^l_{i} \vee \bigvee_{k \in C_l} c^k_{i}\right)
\end{equation}

Clause (\ref{eq:7}) and (\ref{eq:8}) follow directly from the pseudo Boolean model, whereas we add (\ref{eq:9}) to
ensure more propagation when e.g. branched negatively on a set of variables of classes such that a support for an
option is lost and its variable should be false.

Furthermore, for each position an additional sequential counter is used to restrict the number of cars to exactly one. 

%However they are incomparable when it comes to UP and should be added both: 
%
%\begin{proposition}
%    UP pruning is incomparable between (\ref{eq:8}) and (\ref{eq:9}).
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
%    We show two examples: If branched positively on an option, then clause (\ref{eq:8}) triggers by UP all classes that
%    do not have this option to false. This is not detected by (\ref{eq:9}). On the other hand if branched negatively on a
%    class that has one option that no other class has, then that option is set to false by UP through clause
%    (\ref{eq:9}).
%\end{proof}

\subsection{The Complete Model}
\label{sub:complete}


The demand constraints for classes are translated through cardinality constraints.  In fact, we can identify for each
option $l \in O$ the implicit demand by adding up the demand of all classes $C_l$ that require this option.

$$ d_l = \sum_{i=1}^n o^l_i = \sum_{k\in C_l} d_k$$                                                 

Moreover, for each class we may use one capacity constraint of its options as this restriction applies also to the
class. To maximise pruning we choose the strictest capacity constraint with minimal (u/q), e.g. 1/5 restricts more than
2/3. With this setting the translation of classes and options can be uniformly done by the same type of constraints - a
demand constraint and consecutive overlapping capacity constraints. In the following we refer to capacity constraints
both for options and classes. 
 
We define three CNF encodings E1, E2 and E3. All three encode the demand constraint by a sequential counter with clauses
(\ref{eq:1}) to (\ref{eq:5}).  The link between classes and options for all three models is encoded by clauses
(\ref{eq:7}),(\ref{eq:8}) and (\ref{eq:9}). As we have seen in Example \ref{ex:large} and \ref{ex:small}, unit
propagation prunes different values on the translation of the capacity constraints. This motivates us to demonstrate the
difference in the experimental section: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item E1 translates each capacity constraint separately by the clauses (\ref{eq:1}) to (\ref{eq:5}) with a fresh set
        of auxiliary variables. 
    \item E2 translates the capacity constraints by clauses (\ref{eq:6}) and thus reuses the variables of the
        sequential counter on the demand constraint. 
    \item E3 uses both E1 and E2. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Lower Bounds by Preprocessing}
\label{sec:lower}

The idea to this method goes back to the proof in \cite{Gent98} to show a lower bound of 2 for the instance 19/97. Here
we will restate this technique to apply the method on all problems from the benchmark in \cite{Gravel05}. 

We start with instance 300-04 as an example. The demands and options are given in Table \ref{tab:2} . 

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Instance 300-04}
    \begin{center}
    \include{table_ian_1}
    \end{center}
    \label{tab:2}
\end{table}

There are two classes, 21 and 23, that require options 0, 1, 2 and 4 and sum of demands is 9. First observation is that
all other classes share at least one option with these two classes.  Secondly cars of class 21 and 23 have to be put at
least 5 apart, so they cannot share a neighbour. Furthermore, they cannot be neighbour to any of the classes that have a
$1/q$ restriction. This leaves us with the classes that only share the option 1 and for each car at most one adjacent
car can have restriction $2/3$. Since the first and the last car in the sequence can have any neighbour with that
restriction, the number of cars that share no option is at least $9-2=7$. Since there are no such cars, the lower bound
for this problem is 7. 

A similar argument can be made for classes 21, 22, 23 that share options 0, 1 and 2. Here the collective demand is 20
and the supply of cars that have neither of these options is $20 - 13 = 7$. This gives a lower bound of 5, which is
weaker than the first case. 

We unify the two cases into a method that can then be used to compute lower bounds. Given a set of options $B\subseteq
O$ that contain the following capacity constraint: at least one of the form $1/q$ where $q \geq 3$ and at most one with
$2/r$ where $r \geq 3$ and arbitrary many $1/s$ for $s \geq 2$. If the total demand for this set is $d_B$, then there
have to be at least $d_B-2$ cars that do not require any of these options in $B$. The reason for this is as in the
example above. Cars that have all options in $B$ are at least 3 positions apart and thus cannot share an adjacent car.
Cars that share at least one option with $B$ can at most occupy one side since the weakest restriction is $2/r$ and
consequently for a valid sequence cars that contain no option in $B$ are needed. Edge cases (start and end of the
sequence) are removed and thus we need $d_B-2$ cars with no options in $B$. A lower bound is then the difference of
demand and availability of such cars. 

%\begin{proof}
%    still working on it...
%    For convenience we describe sequences of cars by words of the alphabet $\{a,b,c\}$, $a$ denotes a car that requires
%    at least one option in $B$, $b$ denotes a car that requires all options in $B$ and $c$ denotes a car that requires
%    no option in $B$. 
%    \begin{enumerate}
%        \item For each car having all options in $B$ there cannot be cars next to it that require at least one option in
%            $B$.  Neighbours can be shared, so the sequence as $bcbcbc\ldots cb$ is one with least number of $c$s
%            necessary. Thus there have to be at least $k-1$ cars with no option of $B$. 
%        \item Similar to 1) but here neighbours cannot be shared. 
%        \item Neighbours cannot be shared and due to the capacity constraint with $2/q$ one of the neighbors. 
%    \end{enumerate}
%\end{proof}

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:experiments}
                                                                      
First we will compare the SAT encodings of Section \ref{sec:modelling} with pseudo Boolean solvers on the CSPLib
instances. Then we show our results for lower and upper bounds. Our focus is on the 9 traditional instances plus the 30
hard instances proposed by \cite{Gravel05} and we leave out the set of 70 easy satisfiable instances. All instances have
the same set of options: 1/2, 2/3, 1/3, 2/5 and 1/5. The largest instances is 400 cars with 25 classes and a maximal demand
per class of 58. 

We have written a command line tool that generates CNF in DIMACS format from a problem description as provided by the
CSPLib. The tool translates the specification by different sets of clauses and computes the lower bounds from the
preprocessing as defined in Section \ref{sec:lower}. It is freely available at \verb+github.com/vale1410/car-sequencing+. For our experiments we choose the well-known SAT solver Minisat \cite{Een03}
of version 2.2.0, that represents a canonical implementation of state-of-the-art CDCL solvers. All experiments are done
on Linux 64bit, Intel Xeon CPUs at 2.27GHs. 

\subsection{The Decision Problem}

We compare to the pseudo Boolean solver (PB) Minisat+ version 1.0-2 \cite{Een06} and to the answer set programming
solver Clasp 2.1.3 \cite{Gebser07}, referred to as PB and ASP respectively. Both approaches offer native cardinality
constraints. We use for PB and ASP the basic model of Section \ref{sec:modelling} and add the redundant constraint for
the implicit demand on options. Apart from the encoding of cardinality constraints this should be equivalent to model
E1. 
      
Clasp solves hardly any instance with the standard configuration. Instructing Clasp to ground all cardinality
constraints to normal rules improves the number of solved instances (using the switch \verb+--trans-ext=all+), so we
will report here with this switch turned on. Apart from that we use the standard configuration for all solvers. 

Clasp and Minisat+ apply different translations for cardinality constraints. Clasp applies an encoding based on counters
and Minisat+ uses encodings through adders, sorting networks and binary decision diagrams \cite{Een06}. In Table
\ref{tab:size} we compare the size of the resulting formula of the different approaches.  Note that ASP and PB do not
differ from model E1 in terms of higher level constraint. So the difference in size is mainly caused by the encoding of
the cardinality expressions. We see that the internal translation of Minisat+ prefers a more compact encoding  and
Clasps encoding is the largest. The sizes of the direct CNF models do not vary much since the difference is in whether
to use clauses (\ref{eq:6}) and/or separate encodings of the capacity constraints.

We show in Table \ref{tab:runtime} the results for the selected benchmark on models E1, E2, E3, ASP and PB with a timeout
of 1800sec. The instances that can be solved by at least one method are shown and grouped into satisfiable and
unsatisfiable. In total 11/39 instances cannot be solved by any approach. We see that the models E1 to E3 perform
considerably better than the one generated through Minisat+ or Clasp (Running Clasp as a SAT solver on our models is
comparable to Minisat). This indicates that the internal treatment of cardinality expressions of both tools is inferior
compared with Minisat on our encodings. 

There is a tendency of model E3 to solve satisfiable instances faster than the other two models, whereas model E1 is
stronger in finding UNSAT proofs. Since E3 is a superset of E1, the additional clauses cost some performance  in finding
unsatisfiability proofs. On the other hand the increased propagation due to the global view is a factor for faster
solving times for satisfiable instances, since E2 and E3 dominate here clearly. Interestingly Minisat+ which in general
performs poor, does in some cases find UNSAT proofs faster than all other methods. Overall, the results show clearly
that it is crucial how cardinality constraints are translated and automatic translations should be handled with care. 

\subsection{The Optimisation Problem}

Moving to the optimisation version of car sequencing we show in Table \ref{tab:lower} the best known lower bounds (LB)
and upper bounds (UB) found by the preprocessing and SAT solving. The column LB(pre) contains the lower bounds
determined by the preprocessing as explained in Section \ref{sec:lower}. The next four columns show the lower bounds and upper
bounds and the time to compute the last instance. For the bounds the number of additional empty slots ranges from 0 to
the best known upper bound in literature. Each run was limited to 1800 seconds and we picked the best results among
model E1 to E3. In the last two columns we compare the bounds that have been published previously to the best of our
knowledge.

Note that lower and upper bounds (LB*,UB*) in the literature are subjected to different definitions of the optimisation
function and cannot directly be compared. Our result show that in many cases the different definitions force the same
upper and lower bound, in others we find that they are incomparable. See 400-03 for conflicting lower and upper bound
between the definitions, this was also reported in \cite{Estellon06}. Instance 300-5 indicates that our version of the
optimisation function allows smaller upper bounds due to a large gap between UB and UB*. For some instances there is
still a large gap between lower and upper bound, and room for improvement.  The method for computing lower bound from
Section \ref{sec:lower} is powerful and reports for many of the instances higher lower bounds than the SAT approach.
Combining the two methods 21/30 of the new instances are solved to
optimality.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have introduced CNF encodings for the car sequencing problem based on sequential counters and demonstrated that SAT
solvers perform well on the instances of the CSPLib. This specialised translation has advantages over automatic translations
of cardinality constraints as done in Minisat+ and Clasp. Furthermore, for one type of the optimisation problem of car
sequencing we have shown new lower and upper bounds and provide the SAT community with a set of hard benchmarks. Our
approach is still work in progress and in the following we identify our next steps and future work. 

To identify the precise advantages of our encodings we will extend the comparison to other CNF encodings for cardinality
constraints, like parallel counters and various types of sorting networks \cite{Codish10}\cite{Asin11}.  We will also
contrast our work in more depth with \cite{Bacchus07}.  We have pointed out some properties of the presented encodings
and we plan to lift this analysis to a theoretical level and prove consistency properties. 

Our experimental analysis still lacks comparison to related paradigms as constraint programming, local search and
integer programming.  We plan to extend the evaluation by comparing these approaches. 

%The set of car sequencing benchmarks in the CSPLib contain the same type of capacity constraints for all options and we
%plan to collect instances from other sources and to generate new instances of greater variety. The benchmark referenced
%in \cite{Solnon08} contains industrial instances with rather complex definitions for the optimisation function and they
%report poor results for constraint programming approaches. A common definition of the optimisation problem is important
%for the research community such that lower and upper bounds can be compared properly. 

We believe there is a generalisation to the method in Section \ref{sec:lower} to arbitrary sets of options. Our results
show evidence that such a structure can be beneficial in determining lower bounds. The analysis of subsets of options
and their collective demand might not only help in preprocessing but also lead to interesting redundant constraints that
can heavily improve early pruning in the search tree. The generation of such constraints is based on an exponential
method in the number of options, but typically this numbers is small compared to the length of the sequence.
