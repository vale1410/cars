Different SAT models for the car sequencing problem
====

Modelling attempts for the car sequencing problem from the CSPLIB

Description of the models
-------------------------

Model: 

1) ASP naive (for each window and option (for each window and option

2) as 1) but one abstraction (variable for option)

3) as 2) but with symmetry + redundant

7) as 3) but all cardinalites replaced by explicit counters

8) attempt to translate to a pure graphical representation [failed]

9) attempt to model exclusively by counters that should archive GAC on
the AtMostSeqCar constraint [to be continued]

10) Model that enforces GAC on AtMostSeqCard with FL (failedLiteral) and
is so far the best model in comparison. There are translations to SAT
and a paper discribing the encoding (ex/p.pdf)
