Different SAT models for the car sequencing problem
====

Modelling attempts for the car sequencing problem from the CSPLIB

Description of the models
-------------------------

Model: 

1) ASP naive
2) as 1) but one abstraction
3) as 2) but with symmetry + redundant
7) as 3) but all cardinalites replaced by explicit counters
8) attempt to translate to a pure graphical representation [failed]
9) attempt to model exclusively by counters that should archive GAC on
the AtMostSeqCar constraint [to be continued]
