Different SAT models for the car sequencing problem
====

Modelling attempts for the car sequencing problem from the CSPLIB

Description of the models
-------------------------

Model: 

1) ASP naive

2) as 1) but one abstraction

3) as 2) but with symmetry + redundant

7) as 3) but all cardinalites replaced by explicit counters

8) attempt to translate to a pure graphical representation [failed]

9) attempt to model exclusively by counters that should archive GAC on
the AtMostSeqCar constraint [to be continued]
