\section{Preprocessing Lower Bounds}

The Idea to this method goes back to the proof in \cite{Gent98} to show a lower bound of 2 for the instance 19/97. Here
we will show how to generalize this technique and apply this method on all problems from the benchmark in \cite{Gravel05}. 

The idea is to compute the demand for subsets of options and its adjacent classes. If such a class fulfills certain
properties, then we can compute the demand of cars that have none of the options. 


The following three cases lead to lower bounds: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item A set of options $O$ that contains only $1/q$ capacity constraints and at least on of them is $1/2$. Let the
        collective demand for this set of options be $k$, then for a legal sequence of cars there have to be at least
        $k-1$ cars that do not have any of the options in $O$. 
    \item A set of options $O$ that contains only $1/q$ with $q \geq 3$ capacity constraints. Let the collective demand
        for this set of options be $k$, then for a legal sequence of cars there have to be at least $2\cdot (k-1_)$ cars
        that do not have any of the options in $O$. 
    \item A set of options $O$ that contain at least one $1/q$ where $q \geq 3$ and exactly one $2/r$ where $r \geq 3$
        and arbitrary many $1/s$ constraints. If the demand for this set is $k$, then there have to be at least $k-1$ cars
        that have none of these options in $O$. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
    For all three cases above, the difference to the demand and availability of adjacent cars give a lower bound on
    the violation of capacity constraints.
\end{proposition}
